Social Random Food Generator [iGottaEat (temporary name for now)]

Description: 
This is a multifunctional “app” that focuses on generating food places within proximity of the user and can either return a completely random one based on criteria, or return a playlist. This allows users to have a diversity of food and keep track of what they’re eating in comparison with other people.
